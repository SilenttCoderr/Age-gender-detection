# Suraksha Drishti - Smart Safety System for Women

**Suraksha Drishti** is a safety-focused computer vision project developed using **OpenCV**, aimed at enhancing personal security, especially for women traveling alone at night.

Originally envisioned as a women’s safety solution, the system responds to a **specific hand gesture**. Upon detection, it immediately:

* 📸 **Saves close up snapshots** of individuals in the surrounding area.
* 🧠 **Detects gender** of the captured faces using OpenCV pre-trained models.

### 💡 Key Features

* ✋ **Gesture-Based Activation** – No need for phone interaction; works with a simple hand gesture.
* 🎯 **Real-Time Face Detection** – Captures all faces in the camera’s range instantly.
* 🧑‍⚖️ **Gender Classification** – Uses computer vision to analyze key demographics.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe, Streamlit
* **Models:** Pre-trained CNN models for gender and age estimation
